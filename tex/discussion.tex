\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Charm++ strong scaling:} poor performance when Chares overload available CPUs
\item \textit{MPI strong scaling:} near-ideal only down to a grid chunk size of around $256\times256$, perhaps due to breakdown of latency hiding
\item \textit{weak scaling:} both implementations take a performance hit moving from single- to multi-node
